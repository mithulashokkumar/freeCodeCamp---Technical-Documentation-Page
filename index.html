            Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
          </p>

            Python can be used for many things. These are some examples:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Servers for web applications
            </li>
            <li>
              Rapid prototyping
            </li>
            <li>
              Create workflows

          <p>Although you don't need programming experience, the following is recommended:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A general understanding of another language.
            </li>

          <p>
            Python is easy to program, compared to other languages like JavaScript. Python requires very little syntax and is friendly to programmers. Every day, more and more programmers switch to Python because of this.
          </p>

          <p>
            Python contans multiple libraries. With these libraries, you can enhance your programming with Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python supports object oriented programming.

          To get started with writing Python, open any IDE and type in the following code:
          <code
            >print("Hello World")
          </code>

          Execute the code and watch it display in the terminal!

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python variables work differently from other variables. In JavaScript, you must declare the "var" then the variable name and assigned value. A semicolon is required at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Python, you don't need any of this. You just need the variable name and the assigned variable.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <article>
          You can declare a variable in one way:
          <p>
            With the name of the variable, an = sign and the assigned value.. For example, <code>x = 42</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Python, global variables are declared by putting the word "global" and then the variable name.
          </p>
          <code>global var_name</code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
        <header>Global variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
            pages the global object is window.
          </p>
        </article>

      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            You can create a read-only, named constant by putting all of the letters in the variable name as capitals.
          </p>

          <code>PI = 3.14</code>
          <p>
            You can always change the variable value in the constant. However, it's recommended that you just leave the variable constant.

        <header>Data types</header>
        <article>
          <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>
                  null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Note that Python is case-sensitive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                </li>
                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>
                  Symbol. A data type whose instances
                  are unique and immutable.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>and Object</li>
          </ul>
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
          you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
          functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
          procedures that your application can perform.

        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <article>
          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

          <code>if condition: execute code</code>
          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
          condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
          statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
          statement, including further nested if statements.
          <p>
            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
            conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
          </p>
          <code
            >if (condition_1): execute code // else if (condition_2): execute code
          </code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <article>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

          <code>while (condition): statement</code> If the condition becomes
          false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
          the statement following the loop.

          <p>
            The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
            If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
            condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
            stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just make sure that the loop doesn't run infinitely. This can crash the IDE.
          </p>

          Example:

          <p>
            The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
          </p>

          <code>n = 0 while n < 10: print(n) n += 1</code>
          <p>
            With each iteration, the loop print n and adds 1 to the value. Once it reaches 10, the loop stops.
          </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
        <header>Function declarations</header>
        <article>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

          <ul>
            <li>def and the name of the function.</li>
            <li>
              A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
              separated by commas.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then a :.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, the following code defines a simple function named
            square:
          </p>

          <code>def function_name(): execute code</code>
          <code>return number * number;</code>
          <p>
            The return part allows you to print numbers without having to declare a print function.
